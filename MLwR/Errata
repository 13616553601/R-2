The line: To better understand how this function works, note that order(c(0.5, 0.25, 0.75, 0.1)) returns the sequence 4 1 2 3 because the smallest number (0.1) appears fourth, the second smallest (0.25) appears first, and so on.

The columns in the table indicate the true class of the mushroom while the rows in the table indicate the predicted values.

Should be:

The rows in the table indicate the true class of the mushroom while the columns in the table indicate the predicted values.

 

The 120 values in the lower-left corner indicate mushrooms that are actually edible but were classified as poisonous. On the other hand, there were zero mushrooms that were poisonous but erroneously classified as edible.

Should be:

The 120 values in the lower-left corner indicate mushrooms that are actually poisonous but were classified as edible. On the other hand, there were zero mushrooms that were edible but erroneously classified as poisonous.

 

Based on this information, it seems that our 1R rule actually plays it safe—if you avoid unappetizing smells when foraging for mushrooms, you will avoid eating any poisonous mushrooms. However, you might pass up some mushrooms that are actually edible. Considering that the learner utilized only a single feature, we did quite well; the publisher of the next  field guide to mushrooms should be very happy. Still, let's see if we can add a few more rules and  develop an even better classifier.

Should be:


According to our 1R rule, if you avoid unappetizing smells when foraging for mushrooms, you will almost always avoid a trip to the hospital. Considering the simplicity of this rule, the accuracy is quite surprising. However, the publisher of the field guide to mushrooms may not be happy about the fact that some of its readers may fall ill, not to mention the possibility of a lawsuit! Let's see if we can add a few more rules and develop an even better classifier.

Regarding the k-fold cross validation, as mentioned in book, to create a train data set we are using credit[folds$Fold01,] and for test data credit[-folds$Fold01,]. These assignments 
should be opposite as training data must be 90% and test data must be 10% for each of the k-iterations. Similarly, for function(x) used to create cv_results, test and train assignments should be opposite to that mentioned in book.

The "tm" package used in this chapter has been updated since the book was written. For version 0.5-9 of the tm package, the code is correct.
 
For version 0.5-10 of tm (2014-01-13) and later, the Dictionary() function is no longer needed.
 
The code can therefore be revised:
> sms_dict <- Dictionary(findFreqTerms(sms_dtm_train, 5))
Should be:
> sms_dict <- findFreqTerms(sms_dtm_train, 5) 
 
For the most recent version 0.6 of tm (2014-06-11), the line:
> sms_dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(corpus_clean)
Should be revised to:
> sms_dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(tm_map(corpus_clean, PlainTextDocument))

The text in the second paragraph is:

A general rule is to begin by setting min.freq to a number roughly 10 percent of the number of documents in the corpus; in this case 10 percent is about 40. Therefore, words in the cloud must appear in at least 40 SMS messages.

It should be:

A general rule is to start by setting min.freq to a number roughly 10 percent of the number of documents in the corpus and reducing this number until R warns you that it cannot fit all the words on the cloud. In this example, we can set min.freq as low as 40 before R gives us a warning. Since a frequency of 40 is about 1 percent of the corpus, this means that a word must be found in at least 1 percent of the SMS messages to be included in the cloud.

 

Errata type: Technical | Page number: 109

The text in the Information box at the end of the page is:

If so, try adjusting the min.freqvalue up, reduce the number of words in the cloud.

It should be:

If so, try increasing the min.freq value to reduce the number of words in the cloud.

Consider the following paragraph:

The entropy of a sample of data indicates how mixed the class values are; *if
there are only two possibilties* the minimum value of 0 indicates that the
sample is completely homogenous, while 1 indicates the maximum amount of
disorder. *In general, the maximum amount of entropy is found from log2(n)
where n is the number of possible outcomes.*
